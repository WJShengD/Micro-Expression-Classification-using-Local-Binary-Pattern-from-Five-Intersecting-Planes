# Micro-Expression-Classification-using-Local-Binary-Pattern-from-Five-Intersecting-Planes
A new feature extraction method, which is improved by LBP-TOP, is preprocessed by EVM.1
Complete operation stepï¼š
1. Extract all the '.zip' files under './aplha26/EVM_image' to get the database preprocessed by EVM (alpha = 26).
2. Extract feature. run '1main_CASME2_feature_extract.m'
3. Recognition. run '2main_CASME2_recognition.m'.

Using extracted features. operation step:
1. Recognition. run '2main_CASME2_recognition.m'.
